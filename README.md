				Online Hardware and Software Support System by Nitya Baranwal
			**------------------------------------------------------------------**
				

	Problem Description:
	-------------------

	The system will be available on an online platform for 24x7 access to the employees, the engineers, the Head of the Department, and the administration. 
	It Helps keep your IT staff productive with fast, accurate, remote technical support for your System environment. It provides defect support for a broad 
	range of Products running on System hardware.
	Factors to consider include the cost of down-time, skills, retention, overheads, customer satisfaction, and many others.

	Employees of the organization use based hardware for their daily work. If for some reason, this hardware goes down it is very
	important to take care of this hardware and in case of fault, that should be repaired on a priority basis. To maintain and support this hardware there 
	exists a separate department, generally known as “SYSTEM ENGINEERS DEPARTMENT”. For any problem, the concerned
	employee must report to this department. Engineers from this department take care of the problem.

	Users:
		1. HOD
		2. Engineer
		3. Employee

		Roles for the HOD:
		
		•	Login into the system 
		•	Register a new Engineer with a username(email) and password and the category (Hardware/software)
		•	Can see a List of all the Registered Engineers.
		•	Can Delete any Engineers from the system
		•	Can able to see all the raised problems.
		•	Can assign any problem to any Engineer.
		
		
		Roles of Engineer:
		
		•	Each engineer has an account by which they can log in. (credentials given by the HOD)
		•	Engineer can view the problem assigned to him by HOD.
		•	Engineer can update the status of the problem addressed by him. i. e. whether it is solved or anything.
		•	They can see a list of all the problems attended by him/her.
		•	Engineer can change his password.

		Roles of Employee:
		
		•	Employee can register himself with his username and password.
		•	Each employee has their account in the system with which they can log in
		•	Employee can register any complaint (hardware/software) through the system. After registering the complaint a complaint id is generated by the 			system.
		•	Employees can see the status of their problem by using complaint id. Status means they can check who (engineer) is assigned to his problem.
		•	They can see all complaints history raised by him/her.
		•	Employee can change his/her password.

			Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)
    
    
    
    		mysql> desc problem;
			+-----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
			| Field     | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |

                                          ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                          
                                          

                                          
        Step 3: Relation among tables:
            
            	Employee table and Problem table have ONE-TO-MANY relationship so we can use primary key of employee as foreign key for
            	Problem table.
            
            	Engineer table and Problem table have MANY-TO-MANY relationship so we need to create a new table for establishing this relation
            	viz. Problem_Engineer table.               
            	
            	
            	
                mysql> create table problem_engineer
			    -> (
			    -> problemid int,
			    -> engid int,
			    -> empid int,
			    -> pname varchar(15),
			    -> category varchar(15),
			    -> status varchar(10),
			    -> foreign key(problemid) references problem(problemid) on delete set null,
			    -> foreign key(engid) references engineer(engid) on delete set null,
			    -> foreign key(empid) references employee(empid) on delete set null
			    -> );
				Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.10 sec)                         
                                          
                                          
                
                mysql> desc problem_engineer;
				+-----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
				| Field     | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
				+-----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
				| problemid | int         | YES  | MUL | NULL    |       |

				| empid     | int         | YES  | MUL | NULL    |       |
				| pname     | varchar(15) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
				| category  | varchar(15) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
				| status    | varchar(10) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
				+-----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
				6 rows in set (0.00 sec)       
				
				
				
                                          ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
				
				
				
				
		Step 4: Create a Utility package for database connection.

		DButil.java
		-----------
		
			Class.forName(driverName);
       
            Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
            
            
            
                                          ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            
        
		
		Step 5: Create Bean classes.
		
			1. Engineer
			
			2. Employee
			
			3. Problem
			
			4. Problem_Engineer
			
			
                                          ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                          
                                          
                                          
		Step 6: Create DAO Interfaces and their Implementation classes.

			1. HodDao (I)
			   HodDaoImpl (C)
	
			2. EngineerDao (I)
			   EngineerDaoImpl (C)
		
			3. EmployeeDao (I)
			   EmployeeDaoImpl (C)
		
			
                                          ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                          
                                          
        Step 7: Create separate Exception classes.

			1. HodException (C)
			
		
			2. EngineerException (C)
			 
		
			3. EmployeeException (C)
			  

        	4. ComplainException (C)	
        	
        	
        	
============================================================================================================================================================



		Step 5: Create separate Use Case classes.
		
			A. Use Cases for HOD
			   -----------------
		
				1. Login HOD
				
				
				   // LoginHOD (C)
			
				   username : albert@123
				   password : 1234
				   
			
				2. Register a new Engineer with a username(email) and password and the category (Hardware/software)
			
			
				   // RegisterNewEngineer (C)
				   
				   SQLQuery:  PreparedStatement ps=conn.prepareStatement("insert into engineer(email,password,category,name) values(?,?,?,?)");
			
				   email (username) : provided by HOD
				   password         : provided by HOD
				   
				   
				3. HOD can see a List of all the Registered Engineers.
				
				
				   // ShowListOfAllEngineers (C)
				   
				   SQLQuery:  PreparedStatement ps=conn.prepareStatement("select * from engineer");
				   
				
		        4. HOD can Delete any Engineer from the system.
		        
		        
				   // DeleteAnEnginner (C)
				   
				   SQLQuery: PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement("delete from engineer where engid = ?");
				   
				
				5. HOD can see all the raised problems.
				   
				   // ShowAllProblemsToHod (C)
				   
				   SQLQuery:PreparedStatement ps=conn.prepareStatement("select * from problem_engineer");
						 
				
				6. HOD can assign any problem to any Engineer of same category.
				
			       // AssignProblemToEngineer (C)
			           
				   SQLQueries: 
				   
				   		PreparedStatement ps1 = conn.prepareStatement("select * from engineer where engid=?");
	
						PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement("select * from problem where problemid=?");
	
						PreparedStatement ps2 = conn.prepareStatement("update problem_engineer set engid=? where problemid=? and category=?");

		
                                          
            
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

			B. Use Cases for Engineer
				----------------------	
		
				1. Each engineer has an account by which they can log in. (credentials given by the HOD)
					
					// LoginEngineer (C)
					
					SQLQuery : PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement("select * from engineer where email=? AND password=?");
					 
			
				2. Engineer can view the problems assigned to him by HOD.
				
					// ViewAssignedProblemsToEngineer (C)
				
					SQLQuery : PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement("select * from problem_engineer where engid=?");
					
					
				3. Engineer can update the status of the problem addressed by him. i. e. whether it is solved or anything.
				
					// EngineerUpdateProblemStatus (C)
					
				    SQLQueries : 
				    
				    		PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement("select * from problem_engineer where problemid=? AND engid=?");
						
							PreparedStatement ps1 = conn.prepareStatement("update problem_engineer set status='Resolved' where problemid=?");
				
					
				4.Engineer can change his password.
				
					// EngineerUpdatePassword (C)
				
					SQLQuery : PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement("update engineer set password=? where email=?");
		 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


			C. Use Cases for Employee
			   ----------------------
		
		
				1. Employee can register himself with his username and password.
				
					// RegisterEmployee (C)
					
					SQLQuery : PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement("insert into employee(email,password,name) values(?,?,?)");
				
			
				2. Each employee has their account in the system with which they can log in.
				
					// LoginEmployee (C)
					
					SQLQuery : PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement("select * from employee where email=? AND password=?");
					
				
				3. Employee can register any complaint (hardware/software) through the system. After registering the complaint a complaint id is generated by the system.
				
					// RegisterNewProblem (C)
					
					SQLQueries : 
					
						PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement("insert into problem(empid,pname,category) values(?,?,?)");
							
						PreparedStatement ps2 = conn.prepareStatement("select * from problem order by problemid desc");
							
						PreparedStatement ps1 = conn.prepareStatement("insert into problem_engineer(problemid,empid,pname,category,status) values(?,?,?,?,?)");
					
				
				4. Employee can see the status of their problem by using complaint id. Status means they can check who (engineer) is assigned to his problem.
				
					// CheckComplainStatus (C)
					
					SQLQuery : PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement("select * from problem_Engineer where problemid=?");
					
			
				5. Employee can see all complaints history raised by him/her.
				
					// CheckComplainHistory (C)
					
					SQLQueries : 
						
						PreparedStatement ps1 = conn.prepareStatement("select * from employee where empid = ?");
						
						PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement("select * from problem_engineer where empid = ?");
						
			
				6. Employee can change his/her password.
					
					//EmployeeUpdatePassword (C)
					
					SQLQuery : PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement("update employee set password=? where email=?");
